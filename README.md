# Cecconoid_CC

This is a snapshot of the DRM free version of Cecconoid (https://triple-eh.itch.io/cecconoid) under a creative commons license. 

## Requirements

Cecconoid requries: 

InControl (https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/input-management/incontrol-14695) and will not run without it due to compiler errors. This is a commercial package that I can't distribute. 

Unity 2019.1.xx -- It should now work under 2019.2.xx but there was a 100% crash in some editor versions when writing to the particle array.
