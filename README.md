# Cecconoid_CC

This is a snapshot of the DRM free version of Cecconoid (https://store.steampowered.com/app/683310/Cecconoid/) under a creative commons license. 

## Requirements

Cecconoid requries: 

InControl (https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/input-management/incontrol-14695) and will not run without it due to compiler errors. This is a commercial package that I can't distribute. 

Unity 2019.1.xx -- It WILL NOT run under 2019.2.xx due to a 100% crash in the Unity editor, when writing into the particle array. (Yes, it's been reported, no, there's no fix at the time of writing...)
